# Collapsar server

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/amolkov/collapsar-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/amolkov/collapsar-server)

A simple web service for Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) written in Kotlin.

## Setting up

#### Clone the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/amolkov/collapsar-server.git
$ cd collapsar-server
```

#### API key

The app uses [NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod) to get pictures. You must provide your own [API key](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key) in order to build the app.

Just put your API key into **_src/main/resources/application.properties_** (create the file if it doesn't exist already):

```
nasaApiKey=abc123
```

#### Database configuration

Put your database credentials into **_src/main/resources/persistence.properties_** (create the file if it doesn't exist already):

```
dataSource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/collapsardb
dataSource.username=postgres
dataSource.password=a
```

#### Database migrating

Put your database credentials into **_gradle.properties_** (create the file if it doesn't exist already):

```
flyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/collapsardb
flyway.user=postgres
flyway.password=a
```

Before build you have to update your schema to the latest version with `$ ./gradlew flywayMigrate -i` command.

#### Building

You can build the app with `$ ./gradlew build` command.
